Bike Sharing Demand Analysis

BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider based in the United States, has faced significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is currently navigating the challenges of sustaining its operations in the current market conditions. BoomBikes is actively working on crafting a strategic business plan aimed at revitalizing its revenue once the lockdown restrictions are lifted and the economy stabilizes.

**Problem Statement:**

A bike-sharing system refers to a service where individuals can access bikes for short-term use, often for a fee or even at no cost. These systems typically involve users borrowing bikes from computer-controlled docks, with payment information used to unlock the bike. Users then return the bikes to designated docks within the same system.

BoomBikes aims to develop a strategic business plan to boost its revenue once the lockdown restrictions are lifted and the economy regains stability. To achieve this objective, BoomBikes seeks to gain insights into the post-quarantine demand for shared bikes among the population. This understanding will enable the company to effectively meet the public's needs when the overall situation improves. By doing so, BoomBikes aims to set itself apart from competitors and maximize profits.

**The key questions they seek to answer are as follows:**

Which variables significantly influence the prediction of shared bike demand?
To what extent can these variables accurately account for variations in bike demand?
Leveraging data from meteorological surveys and lifestyle factors, the service provider has compiled a comprehensive dataset on daily bike demand across the American market.

**Business Goal:**

The primary objective is to build a demand model for shared bikes, utilizing existing independent variables. The resulting model will serve as a valuable tool for the management team, providing insights into the nuanced variations in demand associated with different features. This insight will empower the management to adapt the business strategy effectively, aligning it with demand levels and customer expectations. Furthermore, the model will facilitate the management's understanding of demand dynamics in a new market, enhancing their strategic decision-making capabilities.
